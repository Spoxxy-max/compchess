After creating a game it should not directly take the user to the game to play, it should popup something like "Created successfully, wait for an opponent, click join game to see if an opponent" and then when an opponent joins the game, the countdown starts for 5mins then the game starts


The back to home in the game page is not working

There should be a disconnect button next to the connect wallet button which when clicked disconnects the button and takes the user back to homepage

Each wallet connected will be stored on our databse, so, each wallet is unique to another user, like a profile

I created and built the smart contract, where can i send it to you so you can implement it, so the platform will be ready for games

So, when a user wants to join a game, the user must sign the transaction and then the stake will be stored in the escrow, and winner gets the staked SOL, draw everyone takes his money

Start that
